10-Working thru diagrams.

9-Looked a new SAP docs on how to record time...Interesting..... No more review button, it is "check" now.  Network connection dropped,
 and then the search box was expanded over the option on compass...wonderfull...  1.00
// 0.5hrs

8-Met w/Jeff Ayers regarding security... Phew.  Discussed encryption & certs, etc. 12.00
// 0.5hrs

7-Basically we (me) needs to think of this as an "island environment", meaning I need to loose the "we're all behind the firewall" mentality.  
 OK....got it.
 
 Sooo, all access to our API needs to be SSL.  Wow...that'll be a hit.  They present the bearer token, and we have to do some
 authorization to see if they have access to that entity.  If we are running over SSL then we can send PW's in cleartext back.
 
 Certs:
 -We could go with 2-way certs for SSL.  Customer provides their's and we provide ours.
 -Wild card Cert at *.api.ctl.io
  			would yield:  *.database.api.ctl.io
  			
  Using 2-way SSL 2048 certs ECDC, force upgrades perfect forward secracy.   Secure even if hacker steals a public key! Wow...
  
  
 ToDo:
 	-Need to see if we can get a permission added to control portal:
 		"Database Admin", or "Database Manager".
 		
 		Or piggy-back off of "Server Admin"
  
  -Also, we (DBaaS Team) will need to store a userID / password for each customer's admin login to a DB... this will need to
  	be encrypted when stored in DB...then be able to "reverse it" so a support person can see it.
  	
  -Word Press team did something with "split key" for this.
